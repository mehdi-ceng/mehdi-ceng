# About me

ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a Computer Engineering student at Middle East Technical University (METU). I also pursued Mathematics at Bilkent University before transitioning to METU. 

ğŸ’» I'm passionate about understanding how computers and computer systems work together. I'm a big fan of the open-source community and decentralized systems.

ğŸŒ± Currently, I'm diving into learning React and Motoko. 

ğŸ”­ Additionally, I'm working on my little Tic-Tac-Toe game and experimenting with adding new features.
