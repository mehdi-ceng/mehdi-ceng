# About me

I am a Bachelor's student in Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU), one of the top-ranked universities in Turkey. I have also studied Mathematics at Bilkent University for three years before transferring to METU. 

I am passionate about applying machine learning and web/web3 development skills to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. I am eager to join an organization that values collaboration, creativity, and diversity, and where I can grow and develop as a computer engineer.
